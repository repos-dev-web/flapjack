# Hyperwave ðŸŒŠ
Hyperwave is a toolkit for building really fast server-rendered apps in TypeScript.

Run `bun dev`  , visit port 3000, and edit `src/server.ts` to get started!

To build an executable for your current architecture, run `bun run build` 

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) provides the bundler, runtime, test runner, and package manager, and database via [SQLite](https://bun.sh/docs/api/sqlite)
- [Hono](https://hono.dev) is a robust web framework with great DX and performance
- [UnoCSS](https://unocss.dev/integrations/cli) is Tailwind-compatible and generates only the styles used in application code.
- [HTMX](https://htmx.org/reference/) gives 99% of the client-side interactivity most apps need.
